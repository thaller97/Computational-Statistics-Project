# Computational Statistics: Term Paper (Timo Haller, 3349939)

The following Github repository contains my term paper for the course "Computational Statistics" held by Prof. Dr. Janys in the spring semester 2020. 
In my work, I run two simulation studies that explore how <nobr> **Causal Random Forests** </nobr> perform compared to OLS estimated linear models for different sample sizes and different number of dimensions. The simulations are based on data from an online survey which was conducted in 2019 in the US. Many thanks to Peter Maxted, Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfahrt who allowed me to use the data for my project.<br>

My main work is the Jupyter notebook file
