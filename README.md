# Computational Statistics: Term Paper (Timo Haller, 3349939)

The following Github repository contains my term paper for the course "Computational Statistics" held by Prof. Dr. Janys in the spring semester 2020. 
In my work, I run two simulation studies that explore how <nobr> **Causal Random Forests** </nobr> perform compared to OLS estimated linear models for different sample sizes and different number of dimensions. <br>
