# Computational Statistics: Term Paper (Timo Haller, 3349939)

The following Github repository contains my term paper for the course "Computational Statistics" held by Prof. Dr. Janys in the spring semester 2020. 
In my work, I run two simulation studies that explore how <nobr>**Causal Random Forests**</nobr> perform compared to OLS estimated linear models for different sample sizes and different number of dimensions. The simulations are based on data from an online survey which was conducted in 2019 in the US. Many thanks to Peter Maxted, Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfahrt who allowed me to use the data for my project.<br>
<br>
My main work is the Jupyter notebook file [CS_project.ipynb](https://github.com/thaller97/Computational-Statistics-Project/blob/master/CS_project.ipynb). I do not recommend to read it in the Github preview mode because of formatting issues. The best way is to download my repository and to run the notebook locally. Some of my R code is included in the notebook itself. The rest - including the functions that are required for running my simulation studies - can be assessed [here]().


Note that running my simulation in the defaults setting is very computationally intensive and may take several hours. However, in the current version of the notebook all results should be displayed. If not, you can find screenshots of the simulation study results in this [folder](https://github.com/thaller97/Computational-Statistics-Project/tree/master/Simulation%20Results). <br>
